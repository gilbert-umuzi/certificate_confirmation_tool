# Certificate Confirmation Tool

This Python notebook presents a solution designed to automate the verification process for digital certificates. The tool cross-references learner-provided certificates against a predefined set of examples, ensuring authenticity and integrity through both visual and textual comparison metrics. Key features include:

* Learner ID Integration: Validates the presence and accuracy of learner IDs within the certificate files.
* Visual Similarity Assessment: Employs image processing techniques to evaluate the visual fidelity of certificates against established examples.
* Text Similarity Analysis: Analyzes textual content to detect discrepancies and confirm alignment with original certificate text standards.
Comprehensive Logging: Methodically records the results of each verification process, categorizing them as 'Success' or 'Failure', along with detailed similarity scores.
* Outcome Export: Consolidates the verification outcomes into a structured CSV log, facilitating easy review and further processing.

This tool is pivotal for educational institutions and NGOs like Umuzi and the African Coding Network, enhancing their capability to swiftly and accurately validate a large volume of certificates, thereby upholding the credibility of their accreditation processes.
